# Peer Tapp

# Description

* Peer Tapp connects local beer brewers with beer lovers. 
* Users can create an account and post the beers they have brewed or are currently making.
* Users can create events for other beer lovers to taste and give feedback on their beer.

Website is deployed here: https://peertapp.herokuapp.com/
